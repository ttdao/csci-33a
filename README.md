CSCI-33A Assignments 2022

## Intro
As part of my programming certificate, I took this class as an elective. This is also a way to keep track of my progress and being more comfortable with git. 

My code progressively becomes a little more elegant in each project. I started in Java through this certificate program and this is my first time doing Django, especially Python. 


## Projects:

Project 0: Search
Project 1: Wiki
Project 2: Commerce
Project 3: Mail
Project 4: Network
Final Project

## Disclaimer
I'm aware the course reuses the same assignments with slightly different requirements. If you come to look at  the code, sure, but technology is always changing and so the programming grind continues :)
